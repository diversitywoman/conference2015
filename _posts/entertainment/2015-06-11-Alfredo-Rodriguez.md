Discovered at the 2006 Montreux Jazz Festival by Quincy Jones, Cuban-born Alfredo Rodríguez has rapidly risen to stardom under the tutelage of the famed producer. Since arriving to the US in 2009, Rodríguez has appeared on prestigious stages such as the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, the Gilmore Keyboard Festival, Detroit, Umbria and Vienna Jazz Festivals. During his first tour in China, Rodríguez was asked to work with Academy Award winning Chinese Composer, Tan Dun, Grammy® Award winning songwriters Siedah Garrett and Quincy Jones to compose the English-version of the theme song, “Better City, Better Life,” for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. Additionally, he was asked to perform the song at the closing ceremony of the Shanghai International Film Festival, granting him to become the first non-Chinese artist to be bestowed this honor.
On The Invasion Parade, the follow-up album to his stunning debut on Mack Avenue, Sounds of Space,
Rodríguez explores his memories of Cuba, the people and culture he left behind, and finds his new place. Co-Produced by Quincy Jones and featuring a superb ensemble that includes bassist/vocalist Esperanza Spalding and percussionist/vocalist Pedrito Martínez, the record is comprised of nine tracks including originals by Rodríguez as well as evergreens such as “Guantanamera,” Maria Teresa Vera’s “Veinte Años,” and “Quizás, Quizás, Quizás.” Following the success of the album, Rodríguez was nominated for a 2015 Grammy® in the category of “best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella,” for the track “Guantanamera.” Quincy Jones expresses, “Alfredo is very special and I do not say that easily because I have been surrounded by the best musicians in the world my entire life. He is without doubt one of the best young pianists I’ve ever seen and with the enormous skills that he already possesses, his potential is limitless.”
