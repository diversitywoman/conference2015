Dr. Shelley Reciniello has provided psychological consultation to organizations since 1982 through her two companies SRA – Shelley Reciniello, Ph. D and Associates (1982-2002) and later SRA Consultations (2002-2012). Long-term clients were Morgan Stanley, First Boston, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, as well as many other diverse organizations such as Avon, divisions of Exxon, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, in national and global locations. Today Dr. Shelley, as she is popularly known, works closely with senior management, boards of directors, human resources, and diversity departments to provide organizational consultation, executive coaching, and senior leadership development to a wide variety of businesses including fashion, advertising, education, journalism, law, technology, finance, entertainment, and the arts. 

Dr. Shelley has been researching and writing about women in the workplace since 1995. She has helped thousands of women through corporate programs, coaching, and psychotherapy to understand their internal playing field and how it interacts with what goes on externally in the workplace. She created a corporate seminar for client companies entitled “Breaking the Glass Ceiling Within©” focusing on helping professional women overcome external and internal barriers to success, health, and fulfillment. She has written academic papers that were praised for her unique perspective and insight, including “Is Woman the Future of Man: An Exploration of the Potential of Women in the Knowledge Economy and of the Problem of Gender Inequality in the Workplace,” (British Journal of Organisational and Social Dynamics 2011)

Her book The Conscious Leader: 9 Principles and Practices to Create a Wide-awake and Productive Workplace was named a finalist by USA Best Books of 2014.  Principle #6 focuses on how unconscious bias undermines women and minorities and diversity initiatives. Making the roots of these attitudes conscious will go a long way toward make diversity and inclusion a reality. www.drshelley.com
