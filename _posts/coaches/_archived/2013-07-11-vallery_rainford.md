Valerie Rainford is chief of staff to JPMorgan Chase’s (JPMC) Head of Global Compliance. She leads a number of functions in support of the firm’s global compliance and regulatory management agenda including planning and analysis, executive communications, reporting, and project management.

Since joining the firm, Rainford has served in similar roles across the company. She served as chief of staff to the CEO during the 2010-2011 financial and mortgage industry crisis as well as chief of staff to the head of mortgage controls during the resultant significant regulatory change in the mortgage industry. In addition to her chief of staff duties, Rainford was also the lead executive responsible for revamping company policies and procedures and retraining more than 40,000 employees on new standards and regulatory requirements for the mortgage industry.

Rainford joined JPMC in 2007 from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. When Rainford left the Federal Reserve after 21 years of service, she held the position as its most senior African American female – the first in the country to attain the level of senior vice president.

As a diversity champion, Rainford advocated for the Federal Reserve’s inaugural diversity council and the hiring of its first chief diversity officer. At JPMC, she is a member of the Global Diversity Council and the Black Leaders Forum.

Rainford is a graduate of Fordham University. She is the recipient of numerous awards and was featured in the May 2010 issue of Black Enterprise and Adecco’s fall 2011 Tribute to Successful Business Women.
