Yvette Montero Salvatico is a principal at Kedge, a foresight, innovation, creativity, and strategic design consultancy. Before joining the firm, she led the effort to establish Future Workforce Insights at The Walt Disney Company, identifying future workforce trends and leveraging foresight models and techniques to assess potential threats and impacts, emerging ideas, and exciting opportunities for the organization. With 15+ years of corporate finance, HR, and leadership experience, Yvette is uniquely positioned to assist both organizations and individuals in successfully leveraging Strategic Foresight for personal and professional development.

As a business owner, wife, and mother of two, Yvette is driven by the desire to help organizations and individuals discover their innate ability to create the future. She has an engaging style that literally transports clients into the future, helping them make sense of emerging patterns and capitalize on change. Whether it’s a keynote to an audience of 1,000, a more intimate gathering of C-Suite executives, or a one-on-one coaching session, Yvette demystifies the Strategic Foresight discipline, demonstrating how it should be treated more like an operating system and less like yet another “app” for our increasingly complex environment. She teaches clients “how to fish” rather than doing the fishing for them, so they can harness complexity as a broad platform from which to develop new opportunities and create their future, today!

Yvette holds a bachelor’s degree in finance and an MBA from the University of Florida and has membership in organizations such as Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), Network for Executive Women (NEW), and Association of Professional Futurists (APF).
