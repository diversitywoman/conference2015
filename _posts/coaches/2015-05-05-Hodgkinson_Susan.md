Susan Hodgkinson is a trailblazer in personal branding, and founded The Personal Brand Company in 1994. She is a leadership development expert, award-winning executive coach, and professional speaker.  Hodgkinson was the first practitioner in the US to combine 15 years of a corporate marketing and branding approach to developing leaders, and the first to build a leadership development model—“The 5 P’s of Leadership Brand®” --fusing the two disciplines.

Hodgkinson was the first practitioner in the US to create a leadership development model that incorporated the needs and issues of women and people of color into the mainstream framework, vs. creating a ‘separate’ framework for these talent pools.
She works with thousands of professionals in a diverse array of businesses who know they must strategically manage their own professional learning, leadership development and personal brand to succeed—for their company and themselves. 

In 2005, Hodgkinson published The Leader’s Edge: Using Personal Branding to Drive Performance and Profit with iUniverse.  The book has sold more than 30,000 copies worldwide and received the Pinnacle Book Achievement Award in 2009. 

The Leader’s Edge is now considered to be the defining textbook on personal branding for leaders in the US and abroad.

Hodgkinson’s work has most recently been featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Indian Express, The Detroit Free Press, Essence Magazine, The Boston Globe, Fox News, Chronicle, and other major electronic media and syndicated business columns. She holds her MBA from Simmons School of Management and is on the Executive Education faculty there and at other business schools and Leadership Institutes.
