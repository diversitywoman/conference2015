Cathie Black is a well known media and publishing
executive having spent the majority of her career as
President, then Chairman, of Hearst Magazines (think
Cosmo, O, the Oprah magazine, Food Network, Esquire,
Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, Veranda, Esquire and her personal
favorite, Popular Mechanics.) Prior to Hearst, Cathie was
president/ publisher of USA Today in its launch years.
Earlier, she was the first woman to become a publisher of a
consumer weekly when she was named publisher of New
York magazine.

Her career began in advertising sales both at New York and
Ms. For much of her career, Cathie has been a “first”
breaking barriers along the way and paving opportunities
for the younger generation of female executives. She is also
an author, having written Basic Black: the Essential Guide
to Getting Ahead at Work (and in Life), a New York Times
and Wall Street Journal best seller and published in 12
countries.

Today, she lives in the start-up world as an advisor, board
member and/or angel investor in a variety of young
companies, to include PubMatic, Yieldbot, Bark & Co
(BarkBox), Pinks & Greens, Hit Fix and others.
