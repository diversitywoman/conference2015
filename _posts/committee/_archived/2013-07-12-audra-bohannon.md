A respected author, business consultant, leader, coach, and facilitator, Ms. Bohannon’s deep expertise in diversity and inclusion issues and how they impact and propel business performance makes her a sought-after speaker and teacher. She excels at connecting with and inspiring both large groups and individual contributors to move beyond reflection to learning and action.

Ms. Bohannon began her career in the retail sector, and her broad experience extends to the airline, banking, food service, financial, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, non- profit, and technology sectors.

She has written many articles and white papers and, along with Verna Ford, co- authored “Illuminating the Spirit: A Guided Journey.” Ms. Bohannon’s commitment to personal development extends to her community where she teaches EfficacyTM principles and leadership skills.
