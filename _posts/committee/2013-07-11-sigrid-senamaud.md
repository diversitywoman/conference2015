Sigrid Senamaud is the Founder and President of GlobalCon Group LLC, a Diversity & Inclusion Program Management firm. Over the last three years, Sigrid also directs the Diversity Women’s Business Leadership conference.

With more than 15 years of experience servicing corporations, non-profits and academic institutions, Sigrid has played an integral role ensuring Diversity and Inclusion goals meet businesses' needs on a domestic and global level. Her global expertise is particularly noteworthy given that she managed programs in China, India, Japan, South Africa, Brazil, and Western Europe.

Sigrid served as the Assistant Vice President of External Programs for Diversity Best Practices (DBP) and Working Mother Media (WMM), both of which are owned by Bonnier Corporation, one of the largest consumer-publishing groups in America. In that position, Sigrid lead the company’s global conferences, tailoring each to specific countries. Her ability to work across cultures, build strategic alliances among Fortune 500 companies and establish relationships with U.S. and international government agencies directly contributed to WWM’s position as a leader in the global space.

Additionally, Sigrid managed the Diversity Leadership CEO Initiative, which demonstrated the commitment of Fortune 500 CEOs to Diversity and Inclusion and its impact on corporate business. She directed the design and successful execution of complex executive-level summits with participation by CEO’s representing companies including Cisco, Colgate-Palmolive, Ernst & Young, McGraw Hill, The New York Times, Procter & Gamble and Sodexo.

Prior to her role with DBP/WMM, Sigrid was instrumental in the strategic launches of businesses and fundraising programs at The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center and the Driskell Center for the African Diaspora, both housed at the University of Maryland, the American Business Center at Check Point Charlie and Humboldt University, both located in Berlin, Germany.

Sigrid holds a Bachelors degree in International Relations from Syracuse University and a Masters degree in Urban Social Studies from the Berlin Humboldt University.

A German native, she resides with her husband and daughter in Washington, DC, United States.
