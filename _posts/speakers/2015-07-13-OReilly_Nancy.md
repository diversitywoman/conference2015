Nancy D. O’Reilly, PsyD, is an author of Leading Women: 20 Influential Women Share Their Secrets to Leadership, Business, and Life (Adams Media) which contains empowering messages to help women connect to create a better world. As a clinical psychologist, motivational speaker, philanthropist and women empowerment educator, O’Reilly helps women create the satisfying and purposeful lives they want to benefit themselves, their families and their communities.
To accomplish this, she devotes her energies as president to fulfilling the mission of the 501©3 Women Connect4Good, Inc. foundation, which benefits from her writing and speaking services. She also serves on many philanthropic boards, as well as the Missouri State Committee of Psychologists Board of Directors.
Dr. Nancy has a unique combination of life and growth experiences. She previously authored a self-help book, Timeless Women Speak: Feeling Youthful At Any Age, based on her research with more than 1200 women. Her publishing and podcasting careers, community activism, longstanding philanthropy, many honors and awards, and her outreach as a public speaker have given her a unique perspective on what women can accomplish in the world today.
In all her work, she emphasizes the importance of owning one’s power, joining together with others, connecting on a deep personal level, and collaborating. She holds up a vision of how women are shaping the world into a better place. As a Nationally Certified Crisis Team Leader, she served in New York City after 9/11, in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina and in Joplin, Missouri, after a devastating tornado. Dr. Nancy has received a Missourian Award for her service, has chaired a United Way Women’s Initiative, and participated in a United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.
