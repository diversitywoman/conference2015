Wendy  Lewis  is  responsible  for  implementing  game  changing  Diversity  and  Inclusion  strategic  and  metric based  platforms for Major League Baseball's Club franchises, its  Central  Office,  MLB  Advanced  Media  and  MLB   Network.      She   has   developed   and   implemented   the   innovative   and   wildly   successful   Diversity  Economic   Impact   Engagement   (DEIE)   model.   DEIE   is   designed   to   advance   League-­wide   the   level   of  MLB's  workforce,   supply   chain   and   Club   engagement   levels   of   diversity   and   inclusion   leadership   and  progress.   A   key   and   groundbreaking   component   of   the   DEIE   initiative   is   MLB's   Diversity   Business  Summit,   an   unprecedented   diversity   employment   and   procurement   trade   fair   event   that   provides   a  unique   and   substantive   opportunity   for   job   seekers,   business   owners,   emerging   entrepreneurs   and  community  and  advocacy  leaders  to  network  with  MLB  Human  Resources  and  Procurement  executives.  Theses   industry   influencers   are   from   all   30   Clubs,   Central   Office,   Advanced   Media,   the   Network,   and  Minor   League   Baseball.   The   Commissioner   and   other   key   dignitaries   and   chief   executives   are   in  attendance  as  well.      The  Summit  was  officially  launched  in  2012,  co-­hosted  by  the  Chicago  White  Sox  in  Chicago.    The  Chicago  Summit  would  be  the  first  time  in  professional  sports  that  an  event  of  this  nature  and   scope   had   been   staged.   The   2013   MLB   Diversity   Business   Summit   was   co-­hosted   by   the   Houston  Astros   in   Houston,   and   in   2014   the   New   York   Yankees   co-­hosted   in   New   York   City.      The   2014   MLB  Diversity   Business   Summit   greatly   surpassed   all   expectations   in   regards   to   attendance   and   outcomes.    The “DBS” is transforming the employment  and  procurement  pipelines  of  MLB.  
  
Wendy   is   also   responsible   for   the   Diverse   Business   Partners   Program,   the   premier   supplier   diversity  program  in  professional  sports. “DBP” was  established  to  cultivate  new  and  existing  partnerships  with  minority   and   women-­owned businesses. Under Wendy's leadership, a great number of diverse businesses  have  had  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  procurement  process  for  MLB's desired goodsand  services.    Since  its  formation,  more  than  $1  billion  has  been  spent  with  thousands  of  minority-­owned  and  women-­owned  businesses.  
  
Wendy  also serves as a member of the Commissioner's  On-­Field  Diversity  Task  Force  created  in  2013  to  address  the  talent  pipeline  that  impacts  the  representation  and  development  of  diverse  players  and  on-field  personnel  in  Major  League  Baseball,  particularly  African-­Americans.  The  wide-­ranging  group,  which  includes  representatives  from  Club  Ownership,  Club  Front  Offices,  Central  Office,  Minor  League  Baseball,  former  players,  the  Major  League  Baseball  Players  Association,  the  MLB  Scouting  Bureau,  academia  and  collegiate   baseball.      The   Task   Force   focuses   on   the   myriad   of   issues   influencing   on-­field   diversity   and  inclusion  at  all  levels  of  baseball.  
  
Most   recently   she   has   supported   and   continues   to   direct   the   Commissioner's appointment of MLB's newest  diversity  and  inclusion  role,  the  Ambassador  of  Inclusion.  
  
She   has   been   recognized   by   national   and   international   organizations,   is   the   recipient   of   numerous  awards,   frequently   selected   for   publication   features   and   is   a   highly   regarded   key   note   speaker   and  subject  matter  expert.  
  
Wendy  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Science  in  Psychology  from  the  University  of  Wisconsin,  Oshkosh  and  an  MBA from  the  J.L.  Kellogg  Graduate  School  of  Management  at  Northwestern  University,  Evanston,  Illinois.
