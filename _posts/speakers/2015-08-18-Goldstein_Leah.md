What happens when a young girl doesn’t believe in limitations? What is possible when her dreams resonate at such a frequency, that they force themselves into reality? Practically anything, as proven by Leah Goldstein’s stunning example of an unbounded life. 

Prepare to be swept into the mind of a champion – battling bullies, sexism, terrorism and more, as Leah shares intimate details of fear, loneliness and anger amidst an unmatched work-ethic and overwhelming drive to succeed. 
 
By age 17, she was the World Kickboxing Champion.  Shortly thereafter, she enlisted in the Israeli Military and became one of the few female instructors of the elite Commando division, specializing in Krav Maga (lethal hand combat).  Leah then transitioned into a Special Forces unit, combating terrorism and violent crime.  The extreme lifestyle of the secret police eventually took its toll, and she found her salvation on a bicycle.  

She convinced Israel to release her, as she pursued a brilliant 10-year career as a professional cyclist in Europe and North America. A 2005 crash almost took her life, but she fought back by not only returning to professional cycling, but completing the most successful year of her career. Another crash in 2010 accelerated her decision to retire from the professional circuit. Switching to ultra-distance cycling, she had an undefeated, record breaking three-year stint, including an epic victory in the world’s toughest bike race—the 3,000-mile, Race Across America.

Today Leah shares her story and the lessons she has learned in her stunning memoir, “No Limits”. Through discrimination, self-doubt, and missteps, she shows how astonishing achievements can be reached, one unflinching goal at a time.
