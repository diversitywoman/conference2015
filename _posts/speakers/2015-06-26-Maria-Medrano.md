As a Sr. Manager within the Office of Inclusion and Collaboration (OIC), Maria leads Cisco’s
global strategic initiatives and I&C Community strategy. She leverages Cisco’s collaborative
technology to create business-relevant strategies and programs. These include employee-led
resource organizations (EROs), business initiated networks, and a global I&C ambassadors
program – all designed to add business value by leveraging the unique talents and energy of
Cisco’s diverse workforce. Her passion is around programs and technology that drive inclusive
behaviors and inspire executives to promote inclusion and collaboration within their own
organizations.
Maria serves as a mentor to first-generation college students and works with local schools to
engage students who have an interest in technology careers. She is committed to the
advancement of women and is a founding member of Cisco’s Connected Women ERO. The
YWCA recognized her for business excellence and career achievement with the 2012 Emerging
Leader TWIN award. In 2013, Maria was also recognized with the Young Hispanic Corporate
Achievers award by the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility.
Maria earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business from San Jose State, a Masters of Arts in
Organizational Development from Sonoma State University, and an MBA from California State
University Sacramento. She currently resides in Sacramento with her husband and three children
where she enjoys spending time outdoors and supporting a number of community and charitable
causes.
