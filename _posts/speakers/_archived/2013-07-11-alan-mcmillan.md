**Navigating From Campus to an Amazing Career**

This workshop is focused on college students who will be volunteering and making this years conference happen as interns.

We will cover key skills to emerge from campus with multiple job offers aligned to your passion, that are economically viable.  

We will cover personal branding. It is not so much what people say about you when you are in the room, but rather what they say about you when you are not in the room. The bigdecisions in your career are almost always made when you are not in the room.  How you build your brand, in an intentional way that speeds your personal development.

We then move on to networking. The notion of how to build, nurture and yes, serve your personal network, and how your network is a big game-changer in your career. It is critical to do this with a processin order to connect and cultivate this vital career asset. In todays socially connected world, it is beyond traditional, physical networking, but virtual networking as well.

You take your brand, what you bring to the table, and combine it with the amplification potential of your network, both who you know and who they know, and put them into a high-activity, process-based job/intern search in order to get multiple offers.

We will end on tactics and strategies of working your next Job Fair on campus, how to stand out and make it the best one of your academic experience. 

This is a combination of awareness on these topics, coaching and laying out action steps to be successful. We will combine this with a big dose of inspiration and motivation to make this coming semester the best of your academic career.
