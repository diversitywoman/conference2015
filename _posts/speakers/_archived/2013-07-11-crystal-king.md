However, Crystal was largely known for many years for her work in multicultural marketing for Susan G. Komen for the Cure®, the global leader in the breast cancer movement; a cause that was a passion following a cancer diagnosis for both she and her mom within a period of 3 years. This lead to her selection by General Mills as a Pink Together Survivor Ambassador where King was featured on product packaging including Cheerios.

At Komen, King was responsible for supporting the organizations inclusion goals both internally and externally as well as underscoring their commitment to reducing the disparities that many women face in underserved communities by creating greater awareness and moving them to action.
