Nika is often called _The Black Lucille Ball_. Like Lucy, she started her career as a fashion model, but soon realized she’d rather make a silly face than strike a pose.  
She was born and raised in Miami to a single mother of 6 kids. When she wasn’t vying for attention, Nika was creating imaginary characters. At the age of six, she was introduced to poetry and began reciting Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou. Her love for the arts grew and soon she was performing plays for the local theatre. She went on to graduate with a B.A. in Theatre Performance from the University of Florida.

Currently, she can be seen on Centric TV’s new hit show According to Him and Her as a “talking head”. Her stand up comedy garnered her a spot in the Shaq Comedy Contest and Centric TV’s Next Comedy All Star. She’s also appeared on VH1, 2 Broke Girls and Nick Canon’s Wild ‘N Out. You can also catch her impersonating celebrities like Rihanna and Halle Berry in her sketch web series called MothaFunnyQuickies!

If that's not enough, she overindulges on organic popcorn, cardio barre and chai tea.
