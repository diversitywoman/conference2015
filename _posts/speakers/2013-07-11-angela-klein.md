Angie Klein is the Vice President for consumer sales strategy and alternate channel distribution for the Verizon Consumer and Mass Business (CMB) organization, which is the wireline division of the telecom giant. In this role she has accountability for sales acquisition strategy for the US footprint of the Fios division, and also has direct operational ownership of the Verizon retail stores, digital search landscape, door-to-door and 3rd party agent channels, as well as the Verizon Enhanced Communities division for business development and marketing to the multiple dwelling unit segment.

Prior to this new role, Angie was the Northeast Area Vice President where she was accountable for revenue and customer growth strategy for more than 25% of the Verizon CMB unit, covering 3.5 million customers across the states of New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut. She led a team of more than 2,600 employees with responsibilities ranging from regional advertising and direct field and retail sales, to major call center customer care operations, with accountability for more than $5B in annual revenue.

Previously, Angie served as vice president of New Product Development and Marketing Operations, where she lead a diverse team of executives and senior managers to define and deliver on product roadmaps for the Verizon FiOS portfolio, in addition to other value-added services.  Ms. Klein also managed the strategic partnership with DIRECTV, had oversight of a $100M+ annual capital development budget, led customer delivery design for major programs, and supported systems execution and performance assurance management for marketing across the voice, Internet and TV businesses.

After joining Verizon in 2001 in a 2-year development program, Angie quickly worked her way up the corporate ladder. Her role as one of the initial members of the Verizon FiOS team served as a career launching pad. She has held roles such as Director of Broadband Solutions overseeing the FiOS customer experience, and Director of Core Product Line Management defining pricing and offer strategy across the Verizon footprint. Ms. Klein also has led the Go To Market function across the Telecom segment, inclusive of execution design and training development for more than 10k sales reps nationwide. 

Klein holds bachelor's degrees from the University of Nebraska in both business and journalism.  In addition to the College of Business Young Alumni Board, she has served on the Nebraska Alumni Association's Board of Directors and was a two-term member of the Alumni Advisory Council. She is also a member of the Nebraska Women’s Leadership Network, a women’s mentoring and networking group, and serves on the Lower East Side Girls Club Board of Directors in New York City.  Angie was the recipient of the Nebraska Young Alumni Achievement Award in 2011, and honored as a Nebraska Alumni Master in 2014. In 2015, she was presented with the This Woman Means Business award at the annual Marketing to Women Conference.
