Sheila Robinson is Owner and Publisher of _Diversity Woman Magazine_, a professional business magazine for women leaders, executives and entrepreneurs of all races, cultures and backgrounds. Due to the overwhelming national response to her first magazine, _North Carolina Career Network_, the publication expanded nationally in April of 2008 becoming **Diversity Woman**.

Ms. Robinson is a former Marketing Director with the textiles division of global chemical giant DuPont, where she traveled throughout the U.S. and abroad tracking apparel trends displayed at industry events including Essence magazine’s annual “Essence Award Show”, GQ magazine’s “Men of the Year Award”, and New York’s “7th on Sixth” fashion shows.

Sheila achieved early career success at DuPont but after she had been with the organization for 14 years, her division was sold. Faced with relocation, she resigned from the company to pursue a long awaited dream - to launch a professional magazine for women seeking career advancement opportunities. As an African-American woman Sheila was no stranger to adversity, and she was strongly committed to providing what she thought to be a much needed resource for women.

Sheila is a graduate of North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Pre-Law. In 2011, Sheila graduated with Beta Gamma Sigma honors in the Entrepreneurship & Innovation Masters Program at Western Carolina University, and was selected as the “Most Outstanding Student” by the College of Business faculty.

Sheila is a graduate of Leadership Greensboro (2006), and Leadership North Carolina (2007) and holds certificates from Stanford University’s Professional Publishing Program (2007) and Wharton’s School of Business Chief Learning Officer Program (2013).

In 2009 she was honored with the MEAC Image Award for her career achievements and as a positive role model for young women. Other honors include the 2011 Minority Business Person of the Year by the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce, one of the 2012 Diversity MBA Top 100 Leaders by Diversity MBA Maga- zine and most recently during the 50th March on Capital celebration she received Kingonomics’s Corporate Diversity Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

Sheila has been featured on the cover of _Publishing Executive Magazine_ and named as one of 50 Top Women in Magazine Publishing for the significant contribution she has made in her industry.

She is currently pursuing an Executive Doctorate in Leadership at the University of Pennsylvania (2015).
