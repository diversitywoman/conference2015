Wendy Lewis, Senior Vice President of Diversity and Strategic Alliances for Major League Baseball implements MLB’s Diversity Economic Impact Engagement initiative (DEIE), which is designed to advance the level of MLB’s current workforce and supplier diversity efforts League-wide. As part of the DEIE initiative, Wendy spearheaded the first MLB Diversity Business Summit, a diversity employment and procurement event that provided a unique opportunity for job seekers, business owners and entrepreneurs to network with MLB representatives from all 30 MLB Clubs, MLB Network, MLB Advanced Media and Minor League Baseball Clubs. The 2012 Summit, which was co-hosted by the Chicago White Sox in Chicago, was the first time in professional sports that an event of this nature had been staged at the diversity engagement level. The 2013 MLB Diversity Business Summit was co-hosted by the Houston Astros. The 2014 Diversity Summit will be co-hosted by the New York Yankees.

Wendy is also responsible for the Diverse Business Partners Program, the premier supplier diversity program in professional sports established to cultivate new and existing partnerships with minority and women-owned businesses. Under Wendy’s leadership, a greater number of diverse businesses have had an opportunity to participate in the procurement process for MLB’s desired goods and services, and since its formation, more than $800 million have been spent with thousands of minority-owned and women-owned businesses.

Wendy also serves as a member of the MLB On-Field Diversity Task Force, created in 2013 to address the talent pipeline that impacts the representation and development of diverse players and on-field personnel in Major League Baseball, particularly African-Americans. The wide-ranging group, which includes representatives from Club ownership, Club front offices, MLB’s Central Office, Minor League Baseball, former players, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the MLB Scouting Bureau, and collegiate baseball, will focus on the myriad of issues influencing on-field diversity at all levels of baseball.

Wendy holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh and an MBA from the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
