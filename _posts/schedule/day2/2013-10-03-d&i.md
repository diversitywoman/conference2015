D&I Effective Leadership During Challenging Times

Corporate America is no longer running for cover from social and civil right
issues. Companies are responding faster than ever to civil rights issues as social
media is leveraged in exponential ways.
Spurred by unsettling incidences, the CEO of a retail giant announced to remove all
confederate flag merchandise from their stores, knowing that this decision may have a
negative impact on sales. Another CEO launched a national youth opportunities
initiative that has resulted in employment commitments from many of America’s largest
corporations. It is apparent that the lines of profitability and social consciousness are
intersecting.
This session will highlight the overwhelming civil controversies in our communities and
how they are impacting our employees, customers and companies.
Hear from leading executives how they leverage their role and D&I to build their
company’s brand, Corporate Social Responsibility [CSR] initiatives and take an active
role in advising top leadership in how to respond to civil unrest.
