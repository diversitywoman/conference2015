Come meet the dynamic duo of Leah Goldstein, world champion cyclist and blackbelt and Lori Moger, for a wake-up stroll around the beautiful Disney Yacht Club Resort! We’ll stretch our legs while we stretch our minds, sharing insights on health, life-balance and kicking butt! Yes, as women we must be able to do all of these. At once. Join us for an easy-going, informal rap session about putting yourself first.

Can you live a life with “No Limits”? With lessons from her new memoir, Leah Goldstein shares specific techniques on combating the forces holding you back. Is it lack of time? Focus? Perhaps something you feel you can’t control? Leah has faced them all, and conquered life with an insatiable desire to move forward. With the right tools, we can all bust through life’s challenges.
