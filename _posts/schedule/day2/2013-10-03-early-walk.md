Leah Goldstein, previous Israeli secret police officer (and world champion cyclist
and blackbelt), will show you how to overcome obstacles, literally! Bring a towel
and be ready for a secret agent scavenger hunt. You will traverse a simple
obstacle course (fun and for all fitness levels), and overcome the barriers that
try to impede your success!
