As an increasing number of women join the C-suite ranks of well-known companies, the media has tracked their every move. From Yahoo! to Ebay to Facebook to the State Department, women in key roles are being closely followed for decisions ranging from changes in benefits to changes in hairstyles. Why is it that being a female leader generates so much attention? Is this a natural element of progress, or does it demonstrate a step backward for women who simply want to LEAD? Join a diverse panel of female leaders from across the public and private sectors, and from a range of industries, for their perspectives on whether a double standard exists in the C-Suite and learn about positive and negative notoriety theyâ€™ve experienced in their leadership roles.
