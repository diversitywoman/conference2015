Stale. Stuck. Spiritless. This is what a leader, then a team, and ultimately a
business becomes when mojo is lost. In order for leaders to reinvigorate
and ignite a fresh mindset that enables a team and a practice to thrive, they
must stop communicating and start connecting.
Connection begins when leaders make a commitment to bring out the best
in themselves and then do the same for everyone around them. This
challenges team members to raise the bar on their engagement and
productivity. The ultimate benefactors of this shift in thinking are customers
who opt-in to become your brand champions.
Upon completion of this course, participants will emerge from this highly
interactive session with a plan of action and will be able to:
- Revitalize their role within their team and line of business.
- Improve their ability to connect with their team, instead of just
communicating.
- Create a high-performing team that exceeds expectations.
