According to Deloitte’s study on Generations in the Workplace, within the
next 6 to10 years, Gen X and Gen Y will constitute a workforce nearly the
size of the Baby Boom generation. These numbers make a powerful
business case for why companies must understand and leverage
generational differences.
This session will reflect on the skills and perspective needed to lead
different generations—and the knowledge that can be harnessed from
them. Learn how:
- generational changes in the workforce are influencing the
marketplace
- to foster collaboration among intergenerational teams
- innovation and growth takes place when a company’s generations
come together
