A seasoned international executive, and currently the leader of America’s largest single-site workforce, George A. Kalogridis  is a vocal champion of diversity and inclusion. As he says, “The Walt Disney Company thrives on creativity, great storytelling and exceptional imagination. When you’re looking for people who possess those strengths, you absolutely have to keep open every door and every window. Otherwise, you run the risk of missing out on the individual who can take us to the next level.” As he welcomes the 2015 National Diversity Women’s Business Leadership conference, George will explain how keeping those doors and windows open have helped make Disney the globally respected brand that it is today.
