The important and often overlooked connection Mindfulness is a concept
and practice that is being embraced the world. Time Magazine called it a
“Mindful Revolution,” and the mindfulness session at the World EconomicForum had standing room only. Numerous global articles and blogs have
connected mindfulness to inner peace, better decision making, potential
increase in empathy, and more. Many leaders are sharing their views on the
importance of mindfulness and meditation for the individual and
organization. The elements of mindfulness practice can include clearer
thinking, openness, and non-judgement What does this mean for us as
diversity and inclusion practitioners? Is there a connection to our work? In
this interactive session we will explore: 
• What is Mindfulness? Mindful Leadership?
• What is the connection between mindfulness and diversity and inclusion?
• How might mindfulness help us with “diversity fatigue?” Resistance?
Challenges to equity?
