According to Deloitte’s study on Generations in the Workplace, within the next 6 to10
years, Gen X and Gen Y will constitute a workforce nearly the size of the Baby Boom
generation. These numbers make a powerful business case for why companies must

This session will reflect on the skills and perspective needed to lead different

-generational changes in the workforce are influencing the marketplace

-to foster collaboration among intergenerational teams
