Women’s Leadership is stuck in most organizations for two common and recurring reasons. First, while senior leaders (still 85% men) are often times in agreement that there is a need for change, many lack the sense of urgency to drive that change. Second, those organizations where senior leaders embrace and drive change, many do not take a truly integrated approach to promoting women’s leadership that is supported consistently across the organization. Attendees of this presentation will leave with an understanding of what steps you can take that will allow you to:

-Build your company’s business case for women in the marketplace and in the workplace

-Drive more revenue by understanding women as consumers and customers

-Drive operating effectiveness and profit through talent and workplace strategies designed to recruit, retain, and advance women

-Apply best practices from VivaWomen!, Publicis Groupe’s global women’s initiative, including the application of its highly successful “freedom within a framework” model

-Engage male champions as sponsors for women’s leadership strategies

Join Joanna Lane, one of the leaders of Publicis Groupe’s VivaWomen! initiative and Jeffery Tobias Halter, for a conversation on the importance, strategies and challenges that come with developing a strong women’s network and ways to engage male champions for optimal success.
