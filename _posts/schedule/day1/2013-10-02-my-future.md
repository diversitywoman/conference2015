The chorus of women’s empowerment champions encouraging women to
take ownership of their careers has grown much louder recently with
thought leaders like Sheryl Sandberg encouraging us to “Lean In.” Yet,
gone are the days of moving up the conventional career ladder within a
single company. With increased complexity, ambiguity, and volatility in
business, career paths are unfolding more organically. Careers can no
longer be encapsulated within the walls of the organization. Today, we are
seeing the emergence of a landscape in which women are reframing the
entire meaning of work, exploring careers across different disciplines and
functional areas, embracing their creative and entrepreneurial spirits, and
finding work that fulfills their destiny. In this new environment, women need
a more holistic approach to career development, one that allows them to
capitalize on their networks, enhance their leadership skills, and unify their
personal and professional vision for the most profound impact.During this workshop participants will:
- apply the principles of Strategic Foresight (long lauded for their
business planning success at the corporate level) to chart a course
toward their aspirational futures.
- learn and apply the process of designing their own, aspirational
career path, informed by external trends, internal inquiry, and with
the support of fellow participants.
