Progress in women’s advancement has slowed considerably in recent years. An earlier generation’s hope that filling the pipeline would eventually produce parity up through the ranks has clearly not materialized. At the same time, organizations’ widespread adoption of policies prohibiting gender discrimination, while opening many doors to women, have also failed to close the gender gap at more senior levels, suggesting that impediments to women’s advancement are more complex and elusive than deliberate forms of gender discrimination.
