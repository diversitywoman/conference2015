Our panel will discuss how STEM is the key to U.S. employment and prosperity,
because it is where the jobs are. Economically strengthening women-who are half the
world's workforce-is not only a means by which to spur economic growth, but also a
matter of advancing women's human rights. We need far-reaching and influential
measures to curb the decline in the number of women managers moving up the
hierarchy, and to ensure greater representation of women in science and in leadership
roles. This panel will bring together the facts that illuminate the opportunity and the
gaps for women in STEM education and careers.
