Most Fortune 500 companies have a diversity and inclusion officer who superintends
an impressive array of programs focused on the needs of a diverse workforce. Yet,
reports suggest that full inclusion remains elusive.
Why have inclusion programs stalled on these fronts? One intuitive answer is that
these initiatives have not lived up to the core ideal of inclusion. The ideal of inclusion
has long been to allow individuals to bring their authentic selves to work. However,
most inclusion efforts have not explicitly and rigorously addressed the pressure to
conform that prevents individuals from realizing that ideal.
Uncovering Talent Research hypothesizes that a model of inclusion analyzing that
pressure might be beneficial to historically underrepresented groups. Indeed, given that
everyone has an authentic self, a culture of greater authenticity might benefit all
individuals, including the straight White men who have traditionally been left out of the
inclusion paradigm. To test this theory, this research draws on the concept of
“covering.”
Hear from research that insists inclusion of the whole person will revolutionize
leadership and change corporations for the better. You will be able to identify a plan to
build your own uncovered narrative the story of who you are and take personal
ownership for diversity, inclusion and talent issues.
