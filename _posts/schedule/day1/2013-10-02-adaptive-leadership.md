The 2009 credit crisis shook the global markets and affirmed that
companies must be agile to survive. As markets change, there is increasing
interdependence of economy, people and information. At the same time,
businesses face heightened expectations to demonstrate sustainability,
corporate social responsibility (CSR) and transparency. These shifts require
a transformation from the old prescriptive leadership model to a new, more
adaptive style. Discover how women leaders can empower a dynamic
network of actors to achieve common goals despite uncertainty. Hear how
an adaptive leadership approach can leverage workforces to give you an
edge in the U.S. and global markets.
